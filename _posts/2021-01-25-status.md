title: Status after two weeks

Status after the [two week improvement plan]({ post_url 2021-01-11-improvement-plan }). 

Plan:

1. Play through one game from [Logical Chess: Move By Move](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NQ1X176) a day. 
2. Solve on average 20 puzzles on Lichess a day. Focus on getting it right, not solving as many as possible. 
3. Play on average at least two 15+10 rapid games a day. Analyze them afterwards. 
4. Read through Dan Heisman's [A Guide to Chess Improvement: The Best of Novice Nook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z99LUM/).

Status:

1. Missed a few days, and still have a few games left.
2. Solved on average about 28 a day. Still only getting slightly more than half of them right. Unfortunately I only have stats for the last six days. Will look into getting data from the Lichess API in the future.
3. I've played 20 rapid games. A little less than I was going for, but I've also started playing blitz. 12 blitz games.
4. I still have quite a bit left.

I drifted off the improvement plan. Still, I studied and played more than I hoped for. After the [1. e4 at 1300]({ post_url 2021-01-19-e4-1300 }) post, I shifted some of my focus to **1. e4 openings**. I haven't spent a lot of time on it, but enough to give me a little bit more confidence in the openings. This also led me into blitz games (a humbling experience so far). [Dan Heisman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z99LUM/) points out the necessity of playing some fast games to practice, among other things, openings. He also argues that you should spend most of your time playing slow games - in order to learn how to "think correctly". This makes sense to me, and I'll try to prioretize slow games in the future. 

This two week period ended pretty well. Good rating trend. Lots of fun games. Learned a lot. I'm pretty happy with it. 

Improvement plan for the next two weeks:

- Play through the rest of the games in [Logical Chess: Move By Move](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NQ1X176)
- Solve on average 30 puzzles a day. Spend time and get them right.
- Play one rapid game a day
- Play two blitz games a day
- Always have at least one correspondence game going
- Play one slow game
- Finish [A Guide to Chess Improvement: The Best of Novice Nook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z99LUM/).
