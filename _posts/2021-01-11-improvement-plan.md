title: Stuck at 1300
---

I'm stuck at around 1300 on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/). When summing up my last week, I see that:

- I go through about 40 puzzles a day, but I only win slightly more than I loose.
- I play about 5 rapid games a day, and I win and loose 50/50.

So, I’ve decided to approach this a little systematically. I believe I’m doing some things right, but I need to be more rigorous about it. 

For the next two weeks my improvement plan will be:

1. Play through one game from [Logical Chess: Move By Move](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NQ1X176) a day. I’m already about halfway, so this should finish the book.
2. Solve on average 20 puzzles on Lichess a day. Focus on getting it right, not solving as many as possible. 
3. Play on average at least two 15+10 rapid games a day. Analyze them afterwards. 
4. Read through Dan Heisman's [A Guide to Chess Improvement: The Best of Novice Nook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z99LUM/).

First goal is to get a stable rating around 1350.
