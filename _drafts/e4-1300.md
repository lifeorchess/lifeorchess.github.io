title: "1. e4 at 1300"
---

**1. e4** (the [King's Pawn Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game)) is the most popular opening move in chess. It’s certainly very popular at my level on [Lichess]( https://lichess.org/). I’ve gone through [my last 80 games]( https://lichess.org/@/LifeOrChess/search?dateMin=2020-12-28&dateMax=2021-01-18&players.a=lifeorchess&sort.field=d&sort.order=desc), where I’ve had a stable rating around 1300, and **1. e4** was played more often than not. 

Of the 80 games, I played 39 games as black. Of those 39, white played **1. e4** – 25 times. That's 64%. Of course, this is a small sample, but it's still interesting. 

I don't believe I should spend a lot of time on openings at my level. I've been focusing on basic principles and simple tactics. However, when more than half of my oponents play **1. e4**, it seems sensible to spend at least some time on the openings beginning with *e4*.

Of the 39, there were some openings that stood out:

| Opening | Played # times |
| ------- | -------------- |
| [Vienna Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Game) | 4 |
| [Scotch Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Game) | 4 |
| [Ruy Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez) | 4 |
| [Italian Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Game) | 4 |

I found this [guide to the Ruy Lopez](https://www.ichess.net/blog/ruy-lopez-spanish-opening/), which I really liked. So for now I'll just start with the Ruy Lopez and see how it goes.

I've opened [a study](https://lichess.org/study/xbLj9MJi), where I will make notes and fill in thoughts on what I encounter.
